# S8il--The-Soil-Predictor-
A machine learning system that uses neural networks to predict soil properties from spectral reflectance measurements (410-940nm). The system accurately predicts moisture content, temperature, electrical conductivity, pH, and nutrient levels, helping farmers optimize soil management and crop yields through non-destructive, real-time analysis.
