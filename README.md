# S8il--The-Soil-Predictor-
A machine learning system that uses neural networks to predict soil properties from spectral reflectance measurements (410-940nm). The system accurately predicts moisture content, temperature, electrical conductivity, pH, and nutrient levels, helping farmers optimize soil management and crop yields through non-destructive, real-time analysis.

## Usage

1. Preprocess the data:
```bash
python src/data/preprocess.py
```

2. Train the models:
```bash
python src/data/train_model.py
```

3. Make predictions:
```bash
python src/data/predict.py
```

## Model Performance

The system predicts 8 soil properties:
- Capacity Moisture
- Temperature
- Moisture
- EC (Electrical Conductivity)
- pH
- Nitrogen
- Phosphorus
- Potassium
